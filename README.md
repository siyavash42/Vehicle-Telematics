### ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Programming:** Python 🐍
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
* **Modeling:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, LazyPredict
* **Interface:** Gradio
* **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Data Storage:** Google Drive (for large `.csv` datasets)

---

### 📥 Data Description

The dataset includes telematics features such as:

* GPS Speed
* Engine Temperature
* Battery Voltage
* Mass Air Flow (MAF), kpl, IAT, and other fuel metrics
* Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC)
* Trip-based time-series data (via `tripID`)

Data preprocessing includes cleaning, deduplication, and format standardization.

---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed using:

* Descriptive statistics
* Correlation heatmaps
* Distribution plots (speed, engine load, etc.)
* Outlier and duplicate detection

Custom features like `acceleration`, `angle_change`, and their squared values were also engineered to support non-linear modeling.

---

### 🧼 Data Preprocessing

* Categorical to numeric transformation
* Missing value imputation
* Outlier handling
* Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
* Sequence reshaping for LSTM: `[samples, time_steps, features]`

---

### ⚡ LazyPredict Model Comparison

We use LazyPredict to quickly compare the performance of several baseline models with minimal code, helping identify strong candidates for further tuning.

---

### 🤖 Machine Learning Modeling

#### ✅ Classical ML Models:

* Random Forest Classifier
* Logistic Regression

#### ✅ Deep Learning:

* LSTM (ideal for time series modeling)
* Conv1D (captures short-term fluctuations)

---

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision / Recall / F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Validation Curves

To manage class imbalance (e.g. `normal` vs `faulty`), we apply `class_weight='balanced'`.

---

### 🧪 Sample Predictions

New sequences can be passed through the entire pipeline (scaling, reshaping, predicting) using trained models.

---

### 🎛️ Gradio Web Interface

A simple web UI built using **Gradio** allows for interactive model testing by uploading CSV sequences and viewing predictions without writing code.

---

### 📚 Key Takeaways

* Sensor data requires domain-specific feature engineering.
* Sequence models like LSTM outperform static models for telematics.
* Automating evaluation with LazyPredict saves time in model selection.
* A clean pipeline with Gradio interface enhances usability and deployment readiness.

---

### 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Real-time dashboard integration via Streamlit or Tableau
* RESTful API with FastAPI or Flask
* Add behavioral clustering for new driver behavior profiles
* Export trained models for use in embedded devices or edge computing
